# This is an alternative input file to create a mesh for this problem
# using the triangle mesh generator. In this file the same physical tags
# (in triangle called boundary marker for lines and region attribute
#  for triangles) are used as the gmsh file.

# This file has to be run with there options
# triangle -pq<optional maximum angle>a<maximum area>AD triangle.poly
# p: Produces a poly file which df2d needs
# q: Creates finite element mesh
# a: Assigns maximum area constraint on triangle
# A: Triangle reads the region number for triangle elements
# D: Is optional. Triangle might produce a higher quality mesh.

# first we write the nodes.
# my df2d does not recognize triangles boundary marker for nodes,
# so we do not use them.
