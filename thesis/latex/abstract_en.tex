\noindent ​A numerical method for simulation of two-phase immiscible flow in heterogeneous, inhomogeneous, two-dimensional porous media containing discrete fractures is provided.  A cell-vertex finite volume method is used to discretize the governing equations and the coupling of equations is handled by the IMPES (Implicit Pressure Explicit Saturations) method. Assuming that fractures are very thin compared to the adjacent matrix, one-dimensional elements have been used for modeling fractures, making the numerical method faster and robuster. In order to verify the proposed method, three benchmark problems are solved and the results are compared to related references.​
